# ZCash Name Indexer

The **ZCash Name Indexer** is a core back-end component of the **ZCash Name Service (zNS)** ecosystem. It reconstructs the entire domain-name state by scanning shielded ZCash transactions, maintains that state in a Sparse Merkle Tree, and cross-checks its own tree against the roots anchored on an EVM contract.

Anyone can run it. That is the point: zNS is secured by *public, deterministic replication*, and this daemon is the thing that replicates.

## 🔐 Trust Model — read this first

zNS is **not** secured by its ZK proof alone, and it is **not** a trusted-sequencer system.

**How commands reach the protocol.** A user sends a shielded ZCash note to the registrar's protocol address. The **amount is the payment** and the **ZIP-302 memo is the signed command** — both in the same note, so intent and payment are atomically bound with no separate reference needed. Block height, index within the block, and input index give every command a deterministic total order.

**Why anyone can check the registrar.** The registrar publishes the protocol address *and its viewing key* — this indexer serves both from `/v1.0/info` (see below). Any third party can therefore:

1. scan the chain with that key and recover every command and payment from genesis, in canonical order;
2. replay them through this open-source indexer, which implements the same protocol;
3. compute the SMT root independently;
4. compare it against the root anchored on-chain.

A registrar that censors a paid command, invents a transfer, mis-credits, or reorders produces a root that **every** independent indexer contradicts. Deviation is publicly detectable by anyone, without permission or special access.

**What the ZK proof is actually for.** It lets the EVM anchor contract accept a state root without scanning ZCash. It proves the transition rules were followed given the supplied inputs. It does **not** prove the inputs were the real chain command stream — replication does that job, and does it better, because an indexer sees the decrypted amount and memo while a circuit would only see a note commitment.

**Property: fraud-evident, not fraud-preventing.** A bad batch can land on-chain and be contradicted afterwards; recovery is social, not automatic.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dual-State Synchronizer**: Parses ZCash transactions alongside the checkpoints read from the anchor contract's own state, and refuses to advance when the two disagree. Checkpoints come from `eth_call` against `rootChain`, never from event logs — public RPC endpoints refuse `eth_getLogs` outright, and a log stream would still report a rolled-back root as current.
* **Compact Sparse Merkle Tree**: A 128-level keyspace in which each leaf floats up to the shallowest depth where its key prefix is unique — so a tree holding *n* domains stores roughly *n* nodes, not 128 per key. Backed by RocksDB through the [`rr-proxy`](https://github.com/ZCashNames/zcash-name-rr-proxy) daemon.
* **Database Consistency**: MySQL two-phase commit (XA) with automatic crash recovery, so MySQL and RocksDB cannot drift apart after a failed commit.
* **Domain Resolution APIs**: Forward resolution, reverse resolution, owner lookup, checkpoint registry, per-domain history, and Merkle proofs for any of them.
* **Self-Verification**: `/v1.0/info` reports `indexer_synced` — whether this node's own computed root matches the last root anchored on-chain.

---

## 🌳 The Compact Sparse Merkle Tree

Two properties surprise people coming from a dense SMT, and both are deliberate:

* **An empty subtree is 32 zero bytes at every height.** There is no ladder of precomputed empty-node hashes. Consequently **the root of an empty tree is all zeros** — a freshly started `rr-proxy` reporting `0000…0000` from `/v1.0/getRoot` is correct, not broken.
* **Domain-separation tags are load-bearing.** Leaves are `SHA256(0x00 ‖ …)` and internal nodes `SHA256(0x01 ‖ L ‖ R)`. In a dense tree these were defence in depth; in the compact tree, where a leaf can appear at any depth, they are what prevents leaf/node confusion.

A proof therefore carries a `depth`, the sibling list, and a `terminal` describing what was found at the end of the path: `Occupied` (the key is present), `Vacant` (the subtree is empty), or `Blocked` (a *different* key already occupies that slot — the proof then includes that key's full record, which is required for soundness).

The full specification lives in the prover repository at `docs/compact-smt.md`, together with an independent Python implementation used to generate golden vectors. This indexer, the `rr-proxy` daemon, and the SP1 circuit must all agree byte-for-byte with it.

## 📡 Protocol Summary

Commands are ZIP-302 memos of the form:

```
zNS:1:<OP>:<domain>:<args…>:<nonce>:<ed25519-signature>
```

| OP | Meaning | Signed by |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `REG` | Register a new domain | registrant |
| `UPD` | Update the target address | current owner |
| `CHG` | Transfer the domain to a new owning pubkey | current owner |
| `LST` | List on the marketplace at a price | owner — this signature *is* the standing offer to sell |
| `ULT` | Delist: withdraw a listing, resetting the price to zero | owner |
| `BUY` | Purchase a listed domain | buyer — the seller's `LST` supplies the other half of the agreement |

There is no separate seller signature on a sale: `LST` pins the price into the tree, and the circuit binds a `BUY` to it by asserting the listed price is non-zero and unchanged. Symmetrically, `ULT` is only valid on a domain that *is* listed.

Supported zones: `.zcash`, `.zec`, `.private`, `.secure`, `.safe`.

Prices are length-tiered (1-character labels cost the most) and defined as protocol constants in `include/Protocol.php`; the registrar serves them from its `/v1.0/prices` endpoint.

## 🌐 HTTP API

All endpoints live under `/v1.0/` and answer `{"response": …}` or `{"error":{"error_message": …}}`. `GET` returns defaults; `POST` with a JSON body selects options.

### `GET /v1.0/info`
Node status. `POST {"extended": true}` additionally returns the domain count and — importantly — the registrar address and viewing key needed to replicate independently.

```json
{"response":{
  "last_processed_coin_block": 3422048,
  "last_checkpoint": {"idx": 42, "block_id": 3422048, "smt_root": "b4c9dacf…"},
  "indexer_smt_root": "b4c9dacf…",
  "anchored_smt_root": "b4c9dacf…",
  "indexer_synced": true,
  "checkpoints_behind": false,
  "domains_count": 0,
  "registrar_address": "u146xylzx0…",
  "registrar_viewing_key": "uview…"
}}
```

`indexer_synced` is the value to watch: `false` means this node's computed root does not match the last anchored checkpoint — either it is still catching up, or it disagrees with the registrar.

### `GET /v1.0/getRoot`
The current SMT root as hex. All zeros means the tree is empty.

### `GET /v1.0/resolve/{domain}`
Forward resolution, with the Merkle proof for the answer.

* `GET /v1.0/resolve/reverse/{address}` — every domain pointing at an address.
* `GET /v1.0/resolve/owner/{pubkey}` — every domain held by an Ed25519 pubkey.
* `POST {"extended": true}` adds creation/update block IDs and the originating transaction.
* `POST {"with_checkpoint": true}` returns the anchored checkpoint instead of the live root, so a client can verify the proof against a value that exists on-chain.

Responses carry `merkle_proof`, `proof_depth`, and `proof_terminal`, which are exactly what a client needs to verify inclusion without trusting this server.

### `GET /v1.0/checkpoints`
Anchored checkpoints, newest first. `POST` accepts `order`, `count`, `from_block`.

### `GET /v1.0/history/{domain}`
Every recorded state change for a domain. `POST` accepts `order`, `count`, `from_block_id`.

Sample requests for every endpoint are kept as `.http` files in [`api/dev/`](api/dev/).

## 🛠️ System Requirements

* **PHP**: 8.5 (pinned in the Docker image and used in production) with `mysqli`, `sodium`, `bcmath` and `ctype`.
  `sodium` is compiled into the PHP 8.5 binary on Debian/Sury, so there is no separate `php8.5-sodium` package to install.
* **Database**: **MySQL 8.0+** (8.4 LTS in the Docker image), with the `XA_RECOVER_ADMIN` privilege — the indexer inspects and resolves prepared XA transactions on startup.
  **MariaDB will not work.** The schema uses the `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` collation, which MariaDB does not implement, and `XA_RECOVER_ADMIN` is a MySQL privilege with no MariaDB equivalent. This is a hard incompatibility, not a preference.
* **Key-Value Store**: RocksDB accessed via the [**rr-proxy**](https://github.com/ZCashNames/zcash-name-rr-proxy) socket daemon, which owns the compact SMT implementation.
* **Transaction scanner**: `resources/rust_tx_scanner`, which decrypts shielded notes with the configured viewing key.
  It is a build artifact of [rust_tx_scanner](https://github.com/ZCashNames/rust_tx_scanner) and is **not** in this repository — the Docker image fetches the pinned release during the build. For a manual install, download it from that project's releases into `resources/` and `chmod +x` it.
* **Nodes**:
  * Light wallet node: Lightwalletd / Zainod (gRPC).
  * EVM RPC node for the chain the anchor contract is deployed on (any Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Runtime configuration lives in `config/<RELEASE_TYPE>.inc.php`; start from [`config/release.inc.php.sample`](config/release.inc.php.sample). Values that matter most:

| Constant | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| `DB_CONFIG` | MySQL connection. |
| `GRPC_NODE` | `host:port` of the lightwalletd/Zainod node. Leave empty to pick a public node from the list service. |
| `EVM_NETWORK` | Chain ID, anchor contract address and ABI path. |
| `INDEXER_ROCKSDB_PROXY_SOCKET_PATH` | Unix socket of the `rr-proxy` daemon. |
| `SMT_GENESIS_ROOT` | **Must equal the genesis root the anchor contract was deployed with.** For a chain anchored from the registrar wallet's birthday this is all zeros — the empty tree. |
| `COIN_GENESIS_BLOCK` | The wallet birthday: the block before which no service transaction can exist. |
| `EVM_THROTTLING` | Microseconds to sleep after each `eth_call`. `0` suits most endpoints; raise it only if one starts answering *limit exceeded*. |
| `EVM_BATCH_SIZE` | Checkpoints fetched and persisted per database transaction, bounding how much an interrupted sync loses. |
| `INCOME_WALLET` / `INCOME_WALLET_VIEW_KEY` | The published protocol address and its viewing key. |
| `NOTIFY_*` | Telegram alerting for fatal conditions. |

> ⚠️ The viewing key and the scanner must target the same network. A testnet key with the scanner defaulting to mainnet fails with *“Viewing key is for network Test but scanner is running with --network Main”*.

Database schema: [`resources/schema.sql`](resources/schema.sql) (tables `checkpoints`, `domains`, `domains_history`, `marketplace`, `params`, `rpc_list`). Incremental changes live in [`resources/migrations/`](resources/migrations/).

At least one row in `rpc_list` for the configured chain is required; the indexer refuses to start without one.

Give each row a **distinct `issue_ts`** (0, 1, 2, …). The indexer selects the endpoint with the lowest value and has no tiebreaker, so equal values leave the choice to the database and make endpoint-specific problems unreproducible. A failing endpoint is stamped with the current unix time, which sorts far behind these seeds — so healthy endpoints are always preferred, and once every endpoint has failed at some point they are tried least-recently-failed first. The Docker entrypoint seeds them this way automatically.

---

## 🖥️ Command Line

```bash
php indexer.php sync       # one synchronization iteration (what the timer runs)
php indexer.php watchdog   # read-only stalled-lock check (what the watchdog timer runs)
php indexer.php clean confirm   # DESTRUCTIVE: truncate all tables, clear RocksDB, reseed genesis
```

`clean` resets the node for a from-scratch resynchronization and requires the literal word `confirm`.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The indexer can be deployed easily as a Docker container. There are two ways to spin up the container: **from the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) image** (recommended for production) or **built from local source files**.

A single self-contained image: MySQL 8.4, the `rr-proxy` SMT daemon, PHP-FPM 8.5, nginx
and cron. That is deliberately not one-process-per-container — the value of an independent
indexer comes from how many people actually run one, and a single `docker compose up`
reaches far more of them than a multi-service topology would.

The usual objection is handled rather than waved away: the entrypoint supervises every
service and **stops the container if any one of them dies**, so it never sits "up" with a
dead indexer inside. Combined with `restart: unless-stopped`, a crashed service becomes a
restart rather than a silent outage.

| Component | Version |
|:---|:---|
| Base | Debian 13 (trixie) slim |
| MySQL | 8.4 LTS |
| PHP | 8.5 (FPM + CLI) |
| nginx | 1.26 stable |
| Scheduler | cron (no init system in the image) |
| Logs | logrotate, covering indexer, rr-proxy, nginx and MySQL |

State lives in three named volumes — `mysql_data`, `rr_proxy_db`, `indexer_logs` — so
replacing the container keeps the synced chain state.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your server.

---

### Method A: Spin up from GitHub Docker Image (Recommended)

To run the indexer using the official pre-built image from GitHub Packages without cloning the full repository:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` and `env.sample` files from the repository's `resources/docker/` directory:
   ```bash
   curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZCashNames/zcash-name-indexer/main/resources/docker/docker-compose.yml
   curl -L -o env.sample https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZCashNames/zcash-name-indexer/main/resources/docker/env.sample
   ```
2. Copy `env.sample` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.sample .env
   ```
3. Open `.env` and fill in your gRPC and EVM RPC settings:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
4. Start the container in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

---

### Method B: Spin up from Local Docker Files

To build the Docker image yourself from the source code:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZCashNames/zcash-name-indexer.git
   cd zcash-name-indexer
   ```
2. Build the Docker image locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ghcr.io/ZCashNames/zcash-name-indexer:latest -f resources/docker/Dockerfile .
   ```
3. Navigate to the `resources/docker` directory:
   ```bash
   cd resources/docker
   ```
4. Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and configure your settings:
   ```bash
   cp env.sample .env
   nano .env
   ```
5. Start the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

---

### 🕹️ Start, Stop, and Management Commands

Use these standard commands from the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file:

* **Stop the container**:
  ```bash
  docker compose stop
  ```
* **Start the stopped container**:
  ```bash
  docker compose start
  ```
* **Stop and remove container + network resources**:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
* **Stop and remove container, network, and ALL persistent volumes (destructive)**:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```
* **View container logs**:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```
* **Query indexer status / verify API (from the host machine)**:
  ```bash
  curl -i http://localhost:8080/v1.0/info
  ```

---

### ⚠️ `EVM_CHAIN_ID` must match the anchor contract's chain

`rpc_list` is queried **by chain id**. Endpoints filed under the wrong one are invisible to
the indexer, so it never syncs a checkpoint — and this produces no error, because "no
endpoints for this chain" is indistinguishable from "nothing to do". `EVM_CHAIN_ID`
(default `56`, BNB Smart Chain) must equal `EVM_NETWORK.chain_id` in the configuration.

Endpoints are seeded from `EVM_RPC_URL` on **first start only**; afterwards, edit the
`rpc_list` table directly.

### 🔄 Server Autostart / Restart Policy

The container is configured with the `restart: unless-stopped` policy inside `docker-compose.yml`.

This ensures that:
- The container starts automatically when the host system boots (assuming the Docker daemon starts).
- The container restarts automatically if it crashes or if the Docker daemon restarts.
- If you manually stop the container (using `docker compose stop`), it will not start automatically on boot until you manually start it again.

No additional systemd service configuration is required on the host system, as Docker handles the lifecycle management natively.

---

## ⏱️ Periodic Execution (`resources/contrib/`)

The [`resources/contrib/`](resources/contrib/) directory provides production-ready templates for scheduled synchronization.

### Systemd (recommended)

| Unit | Runs | Cadence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| [`zcash-name-indexer.service`](resources/contrib/zcash-name-indexer.service) + [`.timer`](resources/contrib/zcash-name-indexer.timer) | `php indexer.php sync` | 2 min after boot, then every minute |
| [`zcash-name-indexer-watchdog.service`](resources/contrib/zcash-name-indexer-watchdog.service) + [`.timer`](resources/contrib/zcash-name-indexer-watchdog.timer) | `php indexer.php watchdog` | 5 min after boot, then every 5 minutes |

**Enable the `.timer`, not the `.service`.** Each service sets `RefuseManualStart=yes` and deliberately has **no `[Install]` section** — with one, `systemctl enable` would pull the service into `multi-user.target` and run it once at boot, outside the timer's control and before its boot delay.

```bash
sudo cp resources/contrib/zcash-name-indexer*.{service,timer} /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now zcash-name-indexer.timer zcash-name-indexer-watchdog.timer
```

**Why a separate watchdog exists.** Systemd never starts a second instance of a unit while the first is still running — concurrent activations are coalesced into one pending job. That is the right behaviour here (overlapping runs would mutate the same tables and the same tree), but it means a sync run can never observe *its own* stalled lock, so the in-run alert can never fire. The watchdog restores that alert from a separate unit. Its check is strictly read-only: it inspects the lock file's age without ever acquiring it, so it cannot make a sync run skip a cycle, and it never deletes a lock it does not own. A stalled lock is reported after `SYNC_LOCK_STALE_SEC` (600s by default) and the alert repeats every 5 minutes until the lock clears.

### Cron

[`resources/contrib/crontab`](resources/contrib/crontab) provides 1-minute interval rules. Cron *does* start overlapping runs, so the guard inside the run reports stalled locks by itself and the watchdog units above are unnecessary.
